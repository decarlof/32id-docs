**Sample Guidance**

The facilitate the highest possible frame rates the samples should attenuate as little of the X-ray beam as possible whilst maintaining suffient contrast on the features to be studied. Below is a figure charting the the attenuation length where the thickness of the sample would block 63% of the incoming X-ray beam intensity. It is possible to use substantially thicker samples than indicated at the compromise of the frame rate.
