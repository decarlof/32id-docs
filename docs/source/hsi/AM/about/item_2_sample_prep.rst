Sample preparation
==================
| • **IMPORTANT:**
|   **In computed tomography, in order to obtain 3D reconstructions with the highest quality possible, the sample must remain in the field of view at every angles!**
| 
| • Samples are loaded on kinematic mounts designed *in house*. Our kinematic mounts are made out of INVAR, an alloy with very low thermal expansion coefficient in order to minimize drifts during CT acquisitions.
| 
| • Samples are typically mounted on steel needles. If samples are prepared with FIB, they are usually supported on very sharp tungsten needles. We have also performed experiments with samples loaded in PEEK, Kapton or Quartz capillaries, or fixed on silicon nitride windows (see sketch below). In case of samples like powder or particles in solution contained into capillaries, it is highly recommanded to use capillaries with an inner diameter as close as possible to the width of the field of view. Also, X-ray absoprtion made by the capillary walls can be assessed  on the `CXRO website <http://henke.lbl.gov/optical_constants/>`_.

| At 32-ID, we typically mount our samples on insects pins (`Bioquip <https://www.bioquip.com/search/DispProduct.asp?pid=1208S000>`_, catalog # 1208S3) because they are very affordable and sharp. Sharp tip facilitates sample mounting with our 3 axis micromanipulator and 5 minutes epoxy.
