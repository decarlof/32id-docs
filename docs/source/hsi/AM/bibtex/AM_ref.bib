abstract = {Porosity defects are currently a major factor that hinders the widespread adoption of laser-based metal additive manufacturing technologies. One common porosity occurs when an unstable vapor depression zone (keyhole) forms because of excess laser energy input. With simultaneous high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging and thermal imaging, coupled with multiphysics simulations, we discovered two types of keyhole oscillation in laser powder bed fusion of Ti-6Al-4V. Amplifying this understanding with machine learning, we developed an approach for detecting the stochastic keyhole porosity generation events with submillisecond temporal resolution and near-perfect prediction rate. The highly accurate data labeling enabled by operando x-ray imaging allowed us to demonstrate a facile and practical way to adopt our approach in commercial systems. Laser fusion techniques build metal parts through a high-energy melting process that too often creates structural defects in the form of pores. Ren et al. used x-rays to track the formation of these pores while also making observations with a thermal imaging system. This setup allowed the authors to develop a high-accuracy method for detecting pore formation from that thermal signature with the help of a machine learning method. Implementing this sort of tracking of pore formation would help avoid building parts with high porosity that are more likely to fail. ?BG Thermal imaging can detect pore formation during laser powder bed fusion, helping to ensure quality control.},

abstract = {Understanding rapid solidification behavior at velocities relevant to additive manufacturing (AM) is critical to controlling microstructure selection. Although in-situ visualization of solidification dynamics is now possible, systematic studies under AM conditions with microstructural outcomes compared to solidification theory remain lacking. Here we measure solid-liquid interface velocities of Ni-Mo-Al alloy single crystals under AM conditions with synchrotron X-ray imaging, characterize the microstructures, and show discrepancies with classical theories regarding the onset velocity for absolute stability of a planar solid-liquid interface. Experimental observations reveal cellular/dendritic microstructures can persist at velocities larger than the expected absolute stability limit, where banded structure formation should theoretically appear. We show that theory and experimental observations can be reconciled by properly accounting for the effect of solute trapping and kinetic undercooling on the velocity-dependent solidus and liquidus temperatures of the alloy. Further theoretical developments and accurate assessments of key thermophysical parameters – like liquid diffusivities, solid-liquid interface excess free energies, and kinetic coefficients – remain needed to quantitatively investigate such discrepancies and pave the way for the prediction and control of microstructure selection under rapid solidification conditions.},

abstract = {The presence of $\alpha$/$\alpha$′ on prior $\beta$/$\beta$ grain boundaries directly impacts the final mechanical properties of the titanium alloys. The $\beta$/$\beta$ grain boundary variant selection of titanium alloys has been assumed to be unlikely owing to the high cooling rates in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF). However, we hypothesize that powder characteristics such as morphology (non-spherical) and particle size (50–120 µm) could affect the initial variant selection in L-PBF processed Ti-6Al-4V alloy by locally altering the cooling rates. Despite the high cooling rate found in L-PBF, results showed the presence of $\beta$/$\beta$ grain boundary $\alpha$′ lath growth inside two adjacent prior $\beta$ grains. Electron backscatter diffraction micrographs confirmed the presence of $\beta$/$\beta$ grain boundary variant selection, and synchrotron X-ray high-speed imaging observation revealed the role of the “shadowing effect” on the locally decreased cooling rate because of keyhole depth reduction and the consequent $\beta$/$\beta$ grain boundary $\alpha$′ lath growth. The self-accommodation mechanism was the main variant selection driving force, and the most abundant $\alpha$/$\alpha$ boundary variant was type 4 (63.26°//[10¯ 5 5 3¯]). The dominance of Category II $\alpha$ lath clusters associated with the type 4 $\alpha$/$\alpha$ boundary variant was validated using the phenomenological theory of martensite transformations and analytical calculations, from which the stress needed for the $\beta$→$\alpha$′ transformation was calculated.},

abstract = {In this work, the fundamental processing-structure-property (PSP) relationships that govern laser-based additive manufacturing were investigated with the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. X-ray synchrotron imaging carried out in conjunction with in-situ integrating sphere radiometry enabled real-time energy absorption measurements for a range of melting conditions that varied laser power and velocity. A thermal conduction model that incorporated the in-situ absorption data and final melt pool geometry was used to predict the thermal histories and diffusion distances along the heat-affected zone (HAZ) in the Ti-6Al-4V alloy to provide insight into the solid-state phase transformations that occurred in the unmelted regions adjacent to the melt pool. Resulting microstructural features were quantified using scanning electron microscopy techniques to elucidate changes in solidification behavior. Significant changes to $\alpha$/$\beta$-Ti phase fractions were measured in the unmelted HAZ, across all test cases. Nanoindentation and scanning probe microscopy revealed differences in the hardness, modulus, and Volta potential across the resolidified melt pool, HAZ, and wrought base material. These measurements and simulations can be used to predict how processing changes lead to differences in the as-built performance of titanium parts that are used in aerospace and biomedical applications. This work demonstrates the utility of coupling in-situ absorption data with a conduction-only high speed model, which leads reasonable agreement with the synchrotron imaging measurements and microstructural transformations observed herein.},

In additive manufacturing (AM) the same target must be reached in one fabrication process, involving solidification and cyclic remelting. The thermodynamic and kinetic differences between the solid and liquid phases lead to constitutional undercooling, local variations in the solidification interval, and unexpected precipitation of secondary phases. These features may cause many undesired defects, one of which is the so-called hot cracking. The response of the thermodynamic and kinetic nature of these phenomena to high cooling rates provides access to the knowledge-based and tailored design of alloys for AM. Here, we illustrate such an approach by solving the hot cracking problem, using the commercially important IN738LC superalloy as a model material. The same approach could also be applied to adapt other hot-cracking susceptible alloy systems for AM.},

The elimination of large spatters results in 3D printing of defect lean sample with good consistency and enhanced properties. We reveal that two mechanisms work synergistically to eliminate all types of large spatters: (1) nanoparticle-enabled control of molten pool fluctuation eliminates the liquid breakup induced large spatters; (2) nanoparticle-enabled control of the liquid droplet coalescence eliminates liquid droplet colliding induced large spatters. The nanoparticle-enabled simultaneous stabilization of molten pool fluctuation and prevention of liquid droplet coalescence discovered here provide a potential way to achieve defect lean metal additive manufacturing.},

During the terminal stage of solidification, hot cracking initiates when the semi-solid matrix builds up excessive negative (tensile) pressure induced by thermal contraction. This study presents a new quantification of the trends in the above process: we estimate the volume change brought by thermal deformation through a perspective of energy conservation and combine it with the intergranular volume change induced by grain growth and liquid backflow to derive a criterion for hot-cracking initiation. Based on this, we propose two modified indexes that build on prior work, namely: (1) |dTdfs|11-$\beta$ and (2) |dTdfs|1E¯. Here, T is temperature, fs is the solid fraction of the semi-solid region, $\beta$ is the shrinkage factor and E¯ is the material toughness near the solidus temperature. Evaluating these indexes against experimental data reveals that hot-cracking susceptibility is strongly correlated with the second index and indeed is a function of material high-temperature toughness.},

We quantify process instability across several parameter sets by analysing keyhole and plume morphologies, and identify a previously unreported threshold of the energy input required for stable line scans. The effect of the powder layer and its impact on process stability is explored.

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion is a promising technology for local deposition and microstructure control, but it suffers from defects such as delamination and porosity due to the lack of understanding of melt pool dynamics. To study the fundamental behavior of the melt pool, both geometric and thermal sensing with high spatial and temporal resolutions are necessary. This work applies and integrates three advanced sensing technologies: synchrotron X-ray imaging, high-speed IR camera, and high-spatial-resolution IR camera to characterize the evolution of the melt pool shape, keyhole, vapor plume, and thermal evolution in Ti–6Al–4V and 410 stainless steel spot melt cases. Aside from presenting the sensing capability, this paper develops an effective algorithm for high-speed X-ray imaging data to identify melt pool geometries accurately. Preprocessing methods are also implemented for the IR data to estimate the emissivity value and extrapolate the saturated pixels. Quantifications on boundary velocities, melt pool dimensions, thermal gradients, and cooling rates are performed, enabling future comprehensive melt pool dynamics and microstructure analysis. The study discovers a strong correlation between the thermal and X-ray data, demonstrating the feasibility of using relatively cheap IR cameras to predict features that currently can only be captured using costly synchrotron X-ray imaging. Such correlation can be used for future thermal-based melt pool control and model validation.},

It is shown that a suitable laser power-velocity-hatch spacing combination can result in part production with a relative density of > 99.5% in LB-PBF of HDH Ti-6Al-4V powder. Size, morphology, and spatial distribution of pores are analyzed in 2D. The boundaries of the lack-of-fusion and keyhole porosity formation regimes are assessed and results showed parts with a relative density of > 99.5% could be LPBF processed at a build rate of 1.5–2 times of the nominal production rates in LPBF machines. The synchrotron x-ray high-speed imaging reveals the laser-powder interaction and potential porosity formation mechanism associated with HDH powder. It is found that lower powder packing density of coarse powder and high keyhole fluctuation result in higher fractions of porosity within builds during the LB-PBF process.},

It has been reported that the ambient pressure has a significant influence on the powder motion, but the physical effects of the ambient pressure on the gas flow, powder-gas interaction, and powder behavior are not quantitatively understood. In this work, we have developed the first three-dimensional multiphysics model for LPBF to simulate the molten pool dynamics, depression zone evolution, gas flow structure, and powder motion in a fully coupled manner. The model enables the first quantitative investigation of the gas flow, powder-gas interaction, and powder behavior in LPBF with different ambient pressure levels, all of which are difficult to measure by experiments. The simulation results show a consistent gas flow structure for all different pressure levels, but the gas flow parameters (temperature, velocity, Reynolds number, and Knudsen number) vary significantly with the ambient pressure. Four powder-gas interaction modes are defined by the gas flow around the particle and the gas-induced forces on the particle, and the interaction modes, individually or collectively, control the motion of each particle. With the changes in the ambient pressure and the gas flow parameters, the significance of the four modes to the powder motion varies, and the powder behavior (temperature, force, velocity, and ejection angle) becomes different. A new strategy is proposed to mitigate the powder motion based on the modeling results.},

abstract = {To date, the primary focus of metal additive manufacturing (AM) research has been the development of strategies for fabricating complex architectures, reducing internal stress and optimizing microstructure. Traditional Al alloys have presented further challenges in this effort due to solidification cracking and complex laser coupling dynamics. To overcome these limitations, identification of novel alloys that exploit the rapid solidification conditions inherent in laser-based AM is required. In this work, laser-induced melting of an Al-8Ce-10Mg alloy is revealed to generate a nanoscale microstructure which results in improved hardness, tensile strength, and mitigated solidification cracking (e.g., hot tearing) in single laser tracks in as-cast material and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)-fabricated components. In situ X-ray imaging shows the nanostructure arises from laser-induced melting of intermetallic particles embedded into the alloy during casting and then rapid resolidification of the molten material in $\sim$ 400 µs. The formed Ce-rich nanostructures are highly resistant to thermal coarsening at 300 °C, as confirmed by microscopy and retention of tensile properties. These results pave the way for development of AM-specific Al alloys that possess the ability to form mechanically favorable nanostructures in fabricated components due to the rapid cooling inherent in LPBF.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing technology with the capability of printing complex metal parts directly from digital models. Between two available emission modes employed in LPBF printing systems, pulsed wave (PW) emission provides more control over the heat input compared to continuous wave (CW) emission, which is highly beneficial for printing parts with intricate features. However, parts printed with pulsed wave LPBF (PW-LPBF) commonly contain pores, which degrade their mechanical properties. In this study, we reveal pore formation mechanisms during PW-LPBF in real time by using an in-situ high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging technique. We found that vapor depression collapse proceeds when the laser irradiation stops within one pulse, resulting in occasional pore formation during PW-LPBF. We also revealed that the melt ejection and rapid melt pool solidification during pulsed-wave laser melting resulted in cavity formation and subsequent formation of a pore pattern in the melted track. The pore formation dynamics revealed here may provide guidance on developing pore elimination approaches.},

abstract = {Directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM) is receiving growing attention in many applications, such as repair, remanufacturing, and fabrication of functionally graded structures. However, the laser-matter interactions and melt pool dynamics in laser DED with powder flow are still unclear, particularly in how pores form and flow inside the melt pool during the process. Understanding the porosity formation mechanisms is critical in the qualification, certification, and overall properties of a DED AM part. Porosity is a common phenomenon and can significantly hinder the quality of DED fabricated parts, as the pores can act as sites of crack nucleation and propagation. Here, we reveal four types of pore formation mechanisms through in-situ and operando high-speed high-resolution X-ray imaging in the DED AM process. Our results confirm that porosity within the feedstock powder induces pores in the process. We also observed pore formation mechanisms unique to the laser-based, powder-blown DED process as a result of powder delivery, keyhole dynamics, melt pool dynamics, and shield gas. High-speed X-ray images provide direct evidence for pore formation mechanisms and show that the pores related to the interaction between the delivered powder and melt pool are the largest in size in laser-based powder-blown DED AM. These results will guide porosity mitigation, elimination, and control in DED AM.},

abstract = {Laser based directed energy deposition (DED) is a competitive method for repairing and remanufacturing metallic parts used in numerous industries including aerospace and biomedical. However, the numerous dynamic phenomena associated with the DED process often result in defects such as entrapped-gas pores, lack of fusion, and undesirable anisotropic properties. The entrapped-gas pore, being one of the most common issues, not only influences melt-pool dynamics but also reduces the fabrication quality and mechanical properties of parts fabricated by the DED process. To reduce and further understand this issue, the real-time observation of the pore formation process needs to be studied first. To directly observe the phenomena in the melt pool, high-speed techniques are needed because rapid solidification leads to rapid pore formation and movement. In-situ high-speed X-ray has been proven to be an effective method in investigating the melt pool dynamics and pore formation mechanisms in the laser powder bed fusion process, in which the fabrication process is quite different from that in DED. Here, the high-speed X-ray method is extended to study the formation of entrapped-gas pores. The real-time formation and quantitative analysis of pores under each set of processing parameters (particle velocity, laser power, and spot welding dwelling time of stationary laser) in the DED process are investigated. We found that the DED with a higher particle velocity (3.19 m/s) produced a smaller average pore size of 27.8 µm and a lower pore area fraction of 0.52%. The DED under lower laser power (156 W) generated a smaller average pore size of 20.3 µm and a lower pore area fraction of 1.94%. The shorter dwelling time (10 ms) benefited the decrease of both average pore size and pore area fraction.},

However, a challenge remains in preventing pore defects produced by melt pool instabilities, which degrade part quality. Using X-ray imaging synchronized with ultrahigh-speed (40 ns) absorption radiometry and coupled with high-fidelity simulations, we discovered that periodic oscillations in the melt pool's morphology existed prior to a transition to chaotic and pore-generating turbulence. Over-extension by recoil waves followed by surface-tension driven recession created temporary pores that persisted longer in a multimodal regime. This non-linear hydrodynamics exists in both shallow and deep melt pools, but most strongly affects the latter. Early prevention of this transition will help improve the quality of manufactured parts. This work demonstrates that remote sensing of these oscillations is possible by very high time resolution total light scattering measurements, which is more readily achievable in an industrial setting than 2-dimensional melt pool imaging.},

Despite the many advantages that can be gained by adopting AM, sustained future growth in this industrial sector requires AM to overcome several barriers, most notably, the formation of in-part defects and the high production cost. Motivated by the growing interest of reducing feedstock cost, we studied the cost-efficient hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti-6Al-4 V powder in L-PBF and show that the in-part porosity can be controlled to produce nearly fully dense (> 99.8% density) components by optimizing process parameters. The process map that was developed with the HDH powder offers a general guideline for the usage of non-spherical powder in powder bed AM. In this work, we investigated the size, morphology, and spatial distribution of the powder-induced porosity in 3D and quantified the interaction between the HDH powder layer and keyhole fluctuation in-situ by utilizing advanced synchrotron-based x-ray computed tomography and dynamic x-ray radiography. With the assistance of a Monte Carlo image-based analysis, we propose two porosity formation mechanisms and attribute them to the unique characteristics of the HDH powder bed, i.e., variable local packing and larger particle size.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a 3D printing technology that can print parts with complex geometries that are unachievable by conventional manufacturing technologies. However, pores formed during the printing process impair the mechanical performance of the printed parts, severely hindering their widespread application. Here, we report six pore formation mechanisms that were observed during the LPBF process. Our results reconfirm three pore formation mechanisms - keyhole induced pores, pore formation from feedstock powder and pore formation along the melting boundary during laser melting from vaporization of a volatile substance or an expansion of a tiny trapped gas. We also observe three new pore formation mechanisms: (1) pore trapped by surface fluctuation, (2) pore formation due to depression zone fluctuation when the depression zone is shallow and (3) pore formation from a crack. The results presented here provide direct evidence and insight into pore formation mechanisms during the LPBF process, which may guide the development of pore elimination/mitigation approaches. Since certain laser processing conditions studied here are similar to the situations in high energy density laser welding, the results presented here also have implications for laser welding.},

abstract = {Selective laser melting is used to create Al-1.5Sc, Al-1.5Zr and Al-0.75Sc-0.75Zr (at.%) alloys from blends of elemental Al, Sc, and Zr powders. This study investigates elemental alloying elements (Sc and Zr) which are high-melting and highly reactive, unlike previous work which focused on more concentrated elemental additions of lower-melting, lower-reactivity Cu and Si to aluminum. High-speed in situ synchrotron x-ray imaging and diffraction show that the 20−30 $\mu$m Al, Sc, and Zr powders fully melt and sufficiently mix in the molten state to create, on solidification, a homogeneous distribution of primary, micron-size L12 precipitates (Al3Sc, Al3Zr, and Al3(Sc,Zr), respectively) and nucleate micron-size Al matrix grains, as confirmed by SEM imaging of cross-sections. A second laser pass, simulating a realistic additive-manufacturing build condition, fully remelts the initial volume which shows, after solidification, the same Al3(Sc,Zr) L12 primary micro-precipitates and very fine Al grains. After aging at 300−400°C, the alloys show large increases in hardness, consistent with an exceptionally high number density (1.4 × 1024 m−3) and volume fraction (2.5%) of secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) nano-precipitates with a Sc-rich core and Zr-rich shell, as measured via atom-probe tomography.},

In this study, the evolution of grains within a thin solid plate of Ni alloy 718 during laser processing was probed with in situ high-energy x-ray diffraction experiments. The high temporal and spatial resolution available in the measurement allowed us to study the rapid evolution of the melted region beneath the surface of the sample. The characterization of the evolution of secondary phases, i.e., Laves and carbide, was captured despite the weak diffracted peaks caused by small volume fractions. Thermal history was estimated based on changes in the lattice spacing from the thermal contraction upon cooling. The temporal variation in 2$\theta$ with azimuthal direction revealed the evolution in anisotropy of lattice spacing and thus of the mechanical state during laser processing.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an emerging metal additive manufacturing process. The gas-driven powder motions in laser powder bed fusion have significant influence on the build quality. However, the transient powder-gas interaction has not been well understood due to the challenges in quantitative experiment measurements. In this work, the powder-gas interaction for a single pulse laser illuminating on the powder bed is studied. We establish a multi-physics model to simulate the complex liquid/gas flow as well as the gas-driven powder motions, which is substantiated by high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging. We identify and quantify four characteristic modes of powder-gas interaction in LPBF. The motion of a powder is controlled by one or multiple interaction modes collectively. As revealed by simulations and confirmed by experiments, powders can merge into the molten pool from its rim, be ejected at different divergence angles (powder spattering), or dive into the molten pool to cause significant molten pool fluctuation. Our results provide insights toward the driving forces controlling the dynamic powder behavior, which pave the way for reducing structure defects during the build process.},

@article{Chen2020,
abstract = {The joining of Inconel 718 and 316 stainless steel has notable industrial importance. However, traditional arc-welding has many issues. In particular, the formation of the detrimental Nb-rich Laves phase in the heat affected zone can promote crack initiation and propagation, which leads to poor mechanical properties. The small heat input and the rapid solidification of laser powder bed fusion (PBF) has the potential to suppress this problem. Despite the infancy of the multi-material PBF, it is of interest to investigate the relationship among the process parameter, the microstructure at the materials joining point, and the mechanical performance. In this study, we used high-speed x-ray imaging to in-situ monitor the printing of Inconel 718 tracks on a 316H SS substrate via laser powder bed fusion, followed by post-build characterization and testing with SEM, XRD and nanoindentation. We observed that a higher linear energy density resulted in a more diffused interface and a smaller compositional gradient, but as a trade-off, generated more keyhole pores and thermal cracks. We also showed that the built layer exhibited chemical inhomogeneity at two length scales: a tens-of-$\mu$m-scale compositional vortex due to the melt flow, and a sub-$\mu$m-scale Nb-rich dendritic structure due to the non-equilibrium solidification that led to the formation of the Laves phase. It was inferred that the chemical inhomogeneity may benefit the mechanical properties at the interface by providing more interlocking between the two materials and also by limiting the effect of the brittle Laves phase to potentially short range.},

@article{Simonds2020,
abstract = {During high-power laser metal processing, the absorbed light is intimately related to the molten metal cavity shape. For the first time, this relationship is observed directly and simultaneously by implementing state-of-the-art techniques of high-speed x-ray imaging and integrating-sphere radiometry. Experiments were performed on Ti-6Al-4V solid and powder under single spot laser illumination for laser conditions that cause keyhole formation and collapse. The data from x-ray imaging corroborates that a dramatic rise in laser absorption is due to keyhole formation. We also find that the keyhole area correlates most strongly with energy absorption followed closely by keyhole depth. Furthermore, time synchronization reveals correlations between keyhole fluctuations and sinusoidal variations in energy absorption that occur during nominally “stable” keyhole conditions. Absorption data show a 24 % periodic change in absorbed laser power at a 50 kHz frequency. The absorption peaks correlate to relatively large, open keyholes, whereas images taken at the troughs reveal keyholes with substantial undulations of the keyhole sidewalls. These observations give crucial, quantitative data for computational modeling whose aim is to predict porosity and defect formation.},

Two separate DED systems, one with high powder flow rates to represent industrial-scale DED processing and the other with low powder flow rates for individual particle tracking, were synchronized with the high-speed imaging setup at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory. In-situ x-ray imaging of the DED process using both systems highlighted the influence of powder flow rates. Increased powder flow rates resulted in less laser absorption into the melt pool, leading to a transition from a keyhole mode to a melt pool without a keyhole but with surface fluctuations due to powder flow. Increased velocities of particles during powder flow resulted in a decrease in particle melting times and a greater propensity for porosity formation. Overall, better understanding of the interactions that occur during various scales of the DED process will enable flexibility, control, and new materials development in DED-based additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing and laser welding are powerful metal processing techniques with broad applications in advanced sectors such as the biomedical and aerospace industries. One common process variable that can tune laser-material interaction dynamics in these two techniques is adjustment of the composition and pressure of the atmosphere in which the process is conducted. While some of the physical mechanisms that are governed by the ambient pressure are well known from the welding literature, it remains unclear how these mechanisms extend to the distinct process conditions of LPBF. In situ studies of the differences in subsurface structure and behavior are essential for understanding the effects of gas pressure and composition on the LPBF processes. This article reports the use of in situ X-ray imaging to directly probe the morphological evolution of the liquid-vapor interface during laser melting as a function of ambient pressure and oxygen partial pressure under LPBF conditions in 316 L steel, Ti-64, aluminum 6061, and Nickel 400. We observe significant changes in melt pool morphology as a function of pressure. Furthermore, similar changes in morphology occur due to an increase in oxygen partial pressure in the process atmosphere. Temperature- and composition-dependent changes in surface tension of the liquid metal drive this change in behavior, which has the potential to influence defect creation and final morphology in LPBF parts.},

abstract = {Size and shape of a melt pool play a critical role in determining the microstructure in additively manufactured metals. However, it is very challenging to directly characterize the size and shape of the melt pool beneath the surface of the melt pool during the additive manufacturing process. Here, we report the direct observation and quantification of melt pool variation during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process under constant input energy density by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. We show that the melt pool can undergo different melting regimes and both the melt pool dimension and melt pool volume can have orders-of-magnitude change under a constant input energy density. Our analysis shows that the significant melt pool variation cannot be solely explained by the energy dissipation rate. We found that energy absorption changes significantly under a constant input energy density, which is another important cause of melt pool variation. Our further analysis reveals that the significant change in energy absorption originates from the separate roles of laser power and scan speed in depression zone development. The results reported here are important for understanding the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process and guiding the development of better metrics for processing parameter design.},

abstract = {Powder-blown laser additive manufacturing adds flexibility, in terms of locally varying powder materials, to the ability of building components with complex geometry. Although the process is promising, porosity is common in a built component, hence decreasing fatigue life and mechanical strength. The understanding of the physical phenomena during the interaction of a laser beam and powder-blown deposition is limited and requires in-situ monitoring to capture the influences of process parameters on powder flow, absorptivity of laser energy into the substrate, melt pool dynamics and porosity formation. This study introduces a piezo-driven powder deposition system that allows for imaging of individual powder particles that flow into a scanning melt pool. Here, in-situ high-speed X-ray imaging of the powder-blown additive manufacturing process of Ti-6Al-4V powder particles is the first of its kind and reveals how laser-matter interaction influences powder flow and porosity formation.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is a 3D printing technology that can print metal parts with complex geometries without the design constraints of traditional manufacturing routes. However, the parts printed by LPBF normally contain many more pores than those made by conventional methods, which severely deteriorates their properties. Here, by combining in-situ high-speed high-resolution synchrotron x-ray imaging experiments and multi-physics modeling, we unveil the dynamics and mechanisms of pore motion and elimination in the LPBF process. We find that the high thermocapillary force, induced by the high temperature gradient in the laser interaction region, can rapidly eliminate pores from the melt pool during the LPBF process. The thermocapillary force driven pore elimination mechanism revealed here may guide the development of 3D printing approaches to achieve pore-free 3D printing of metals.},

When compared against data from a state-of-the-art dynamic x-ray radiography technique, good agreement is found for the keyhole shapes and fluctuation of the gas-liquid interface, thereby validating the simulation method. A detailed discussion is then given to elucidate the effects of laser absorption on the dynamic behavior of the front and rear keyhole walls. A quantitative comparison of different driving forces on the keyhole is also given to evaluate their significance to the keyhole dynamics.},

abstract = {A high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging technique was used to investigate the binder jetting additive manufacturing (AM) process. A commercial binder jetting printer with droplet-on-demand ink-jet print-head was used to print single lines on powder beds. The printing process was recorded in real time using high-speed X-ray imaging. The ink-jet droplets showed distinct elongated shape with spherical head, long tail, and three to five trailing satellite droplets. Significant drift was observed between the impact points of main droplet and satellite droplets. The impact of the droplet on the powder bed caused movement and ejection of the powder particles. The depth of disturbance in the powder bed from movement and ejection was defined as interaction depth, which is found to be dependent on the size, shape, and material of the powder particles. For smaller powder particles (diameter less than 10 $\mu$ m), three consecutive binder droplets were observed to coalesce to form large agglomerates. The observations reported here will facilitate the understanding of underlying physics that govern the binder jetting processes, which will then help in improving the quality of parts manufactured using this AM process.},

abstract = {An in situ synchrotron X-ray imaging technique was used to examine laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) of a chrome-molybedum, AISI 4140, ferrite–bainite steel, from a moving laser source. Since 4140 has received only minimal attention in the AM literature, focus here was on the effects of melt pool dynamics, vapor cavity depths, build layer height, and the origin of porosity on the 4140 as-built microstructure. Four build parameter sets, which enabled variation of laser power, scan speed, laser spot size, and specific energy density (SED), were applied. Vapor cavity and melt pool depths were measured for each single-track laser scan. Direct imaging of the LPBF process demonstrated that the primary source of porosity in the build originates from incorporation of entrapped gas within the powder irrespective of build parameter set. High resolution SEM and EBSD demonstrated that the as-built microstructure did not vary significantly with build parameter set over a broad range of SED. The fast solidification rates observed (0.06–0.08 m/s) lead to fine martensite packet/block size distributions (1–3 µm) with the potential for increased material strength.},

abstract = {Powder spreading is a key step in the powder-bed-based additive manufacturing process, which determines the quality of the powder bed and, consequently, affects the quality of the manufactured part. However, powder spreading behavior under additive manufacturing condition is still not clear, largely because of the lack of particle-scale experimental study. Here, we studied particle-scale powder dynamics during the powder spreading process by using in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. Evolution of the repose angle, slope surface speed, slope surface roughness, and the dynamics of powder clusters at the powder front were revealed and quantified. Interactions of the individual metal powders, with boundaries (substrate and container wall), were characterized, and coefficients of friction between the powders and boundaries were calculated. The effects of particle size on powder flow dynamics were revealed. The particle-scale powder spreading dynamics, reported here, are important for a thorough understanding of powder spreading behavior in the powder-bed-based additive manufacturing process, and are critical to the development and validation of models that can more accurately predict powder spreading behavior.},
