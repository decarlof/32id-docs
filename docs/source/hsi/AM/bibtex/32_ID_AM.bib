abstract = {We employ the high-speed synchrotron hard X-ray imaging and diffraction techniques to monitor the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process of Ti-6Al-4V in situ and in real time. We demonstrate that many scientifically and technologically significant phenomena in LPBF, including melt pool dynamics, powder ejection, rapid solidification, and phase transformation, can be probed with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. In particular, the keyhole pore formation is experimentally revealed with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The solidification rate is quantitatively measured, and the slowly decrease in solidification rate during the relatively steady state could be a manifestation of the recalescence phenomenon. The high-speed diffraction enables a reasonable estimation of the cooling rate and phase transformation rate, and the diffusionless transformation from $\beta$ to $\alpha$ ' phase is evident. The data present here will facilitate the understanding of dynamics and kinetics in metal LPBF process, and the experiment platform established will undoubtedly become a new paradigm for future research and development of metal additive manufacturing.},

It is very difficult to investigate this with either conventional characterization tools or modeling and simulation. The detailed dynamics of powder spattering in the LPBF process is still not fully understood. Here, we report insights into the transient dynamics of powder spattering in the LPBF process that was observed with in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. Powder motion dynamics, as a function of time, environment pressure, and location, is presented. The moving speed, acceleration, and driving force of powder motion that are induced by metal vapor jet/plume and argon gas flow are quantified. A schematic map showing the dynamics and mechanisms of powder motion during the LPBF process as functions of time and pressure is constructed. Potential ways to mitigate powder spattering during the LPBF process are discussed and proposed, based on the revealed powder motion dynamics and mechanisms.},

Various significant phenomena, including vapor-depression and melt-pool dynamics and powder-spatter ejection, were captured with high spatial and temporal resolution. Imaging frame rates of up to 10 MHz were used to capture the rapid changes in these highly dynamic phenomena. At the same time, relatively slow frame rates were employed to capture large-scale changes during the process.

However, powder spreading behavior under additive manufacturing condition is still not clear, largely because of the lack of particle-scale experimental study. Here, we studied particle-scale powder dynamics during the powder spreading process by using in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. Evolution of the repose angle, slope surface speed, slope surface roughness, and the dynamics of powder clusters at the powder front were revealed and quantified. Interactions of the individual metal powders, with boundaries (substrate and container wall), were characterized, and coefficients of friction between the powders and boundaries were calculated. The effects of particle size on powder flow dynamics were revealed. The particle-scale powder spreading dynamics, reported here, are important for a thorough understanding of powder spreading behavior in the powder-bed-based additive manufacturing process, and are critical to the development and validation of models that can more accurately predict powder spreading behavior.},

abstract = {Size and shape of a melt pool play a critical role in determining the microstructure in additively manufactured metals. However, it is very challenging to directly characterize the size and shape of the melt pool beneath the surface of the melt pool during the additive manufacturing process. Here, we report the direct observation and quantification of melt pool variation during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process under constant input energy density by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. We show that the melt pool can undergo different melting regimes and both the melt pool dimension and melt pool volume can have orders-of-magnitude change under a constant input energy density. Our analysis shows that the significant melt pool variation cannot be solely explained by the energy dissipation rate. We found that energy absorption changes significantly under a constant input energy density, which is another important cause of melt pool variation. Our further analysis reveals that the significant change in energy absorption originates from the separate roles of laser power and scan speed in depression zone development. The results reported here are important for understanding the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process and guiding the development of better metrics for processing parameter design.},

The printing process was recorded in real time using high-speed X-ray imaging. The ink-jet droplets showed distinct elongated shape with spherical head, long tail, and three to five trailing satellite droplets. Significant drift was observed between the impact points of main droplet and satellite droplets. The impact of the droplet on the powder bed caused movement and ejection of the powder particles. The depth of disturbance in the powder bed from movement and ejection was defined as interaction depth, which is found to be dependent on the size, shape, and material of the powder particles. For smaller powder particles (diameter less than 10 $\mu$m), three consecutive binder droplets were observed to coalesce to form large agglomerates. The observations reported here will facilitate the understanding of underlying physics that govern the binder jetting processes, which will then help in improving the quality of parts manufactured using this AM process.},

In all experiments, the critical flaw was located on the surface of each specimen. The AM specimens showed significantly higher crack propagation speed, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, strain hardening coefficient, and yet lower ductility compared to the cast specimens under dynamic tension. Although the strength values were higher for the AM specimens, the critical mode I stress intensity factors were comparable for both specimens.

However, the parts printed by LPBF normally contain many more pores than those made by conventional methods, which severely deteriorates their properties. Here, by combining in-situ high-speed high-resolution synchrotron x-ray imaging experiments and multi-physics modeling, we unveil the dynamics and mechanisms of pore motion and elimination in the LPBF process. We find that the high thermocapillary force, induced by the high temperature gradient in the laser interaction region, can rapidly eliminate pores from the melt pool during the LPBF process. The thermocapillary force driven pore elimination mechanism revealed here may guide the development of 3D printing approaches to achieve pore-free 3D printing of metals.},

Since 4140 has received only minimal attention in the AM literature, focus here was on the effects of melt pool dynamics, vapor cavity depths, build layer height, and the origin of porosity on the 4140 as-built microstructure. Four build parameter sets, which enabled variation of laser power, scan speed, laser spot size, and specific energy density (SED), were applied. Vapor cavity and melt pool depths were measured for each single-track laser scan. Direct imaging of the LPBF process demonstrated that the primary source of porosity in the build originates from incorporation of entrapped gas within the powder irrespective of build parameter set. High resolution SEM and EBSD demonstrated that the as-built microstructure did not vary significantly with build parameter set over a broad range of SED. The fast solidification rates observed (0.06–0.08 m/s) lead to fine martensite packet/block size distributions (1–3 µm) with the potential for increased material strength.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion is a dominant metal 3D printing technology. However, porosity defects remain a challenge for fatigue-sensitive applications. Some porosity is associated with deep and narrow vapor depressions called keyholes, which occur under high-power, low–scan speed laser melting conditions. High-speed x-ray imaging enables operando observation of the detailed formation process of pores in Ti-6Al-4V caused by a critical instability at the keyhole tip. We found that the boundary of the keyhole porosity regime in power-velocity space is sharp and smooth, varying only slightly between the bare plate and powder bed. The critical keyhole instability generates acoustic waves in the melt pool that provide additional yet vital driving force for the pores near the keyhole tip to move away from the keyhole and become trapped as defects.},

However, the quality and reproducibility of parts manufactured by this technique is still a problem. Overcoming this issue requires an understanding of multiple complex physical phenomena which occur simultaneously during the process. This work illustrates a powerful new technique which synchronizes high-speed x-ray imaging with high-speed infrared imaging to study laser powder bed fusion processes in real time. Using this technique, we demonstrate the simultaneous observation of multiple phenomena including three-dimensional melt pool visualization, vapor plume dynamics, spatter formation, thermal history, and point cooling rates.

abstract = {The joining of Inconel 718 and 316 stainless steel has notable industrial importance. However, traditional arc-welding has many issues. In particular, the formation of the detrimental Nb-rich Laves phase in the heat affected zone can promote crack initiation and propagation, which leads to poor mechanical properties. The small heat input and the rapid solidification of laser powder bed fusion (PBF) has the potential to suppress this problem. Despite the infancy of the multi-material PBF, it is of interest to investigate the relationship among the process parameter, the microstructure at the materials joining point, and the mechanical performance. In this study, we used high-speed x-ray imaging to in-situ monitor the printing of Inconel 718 tracks on a 316H SS substrate via laser powder bed fusion, followed by post-build characterization and testing with SEM, XRD and nanoindentation. We observed that a higher linear energy density resulted in a more diffused interface and a smaller compositional gradient, but as a trade-off, generated more keyhole pores and thermal cracks. We also showed that the built layer exhibited chemical inhomogeneity at two length scales: a tens-of-$\mu$m-scale compositional vortex due to the melt flow, and a sub-$\mu$m-scale Nb-rich dendritic structure due to the non-equilibrium solidification that led to the formation of the Laves phase. It was inferred that the chemical inhomogeneity may benefit the mechanical properties at the interface by providing more interlocking between the two materials and also by limiting the effect of the brittle Laves phase to potentially short range.},

This study investigates elemental alloying elements (Sc and Zr) which are high-melting and highly reactive, unlike previous work which focused on more concentrated elemental additions of lower-melting, lower-reactivity Cu and Si to aluminum. High-speed in situ synchrotron x-ray imaging and diffraction show that the 20−30 $\mu$m Al, Sc, and Zr powders fully melt and sufficiently mix in the molten state to create, on solidification, a homogeneous distribution of primary, micron-size L12 precipitates (Al3Sc, Al3Zr, and Al3(Sc,Zr), respectively) and nucleate micron-size Al matrix grains, as confirmed by SEM imaging of cross-sections. A second laser pass, simulating a realistic additive-manufacturing build condition, fully remelts the initial volume which shows, after solidification, the same Al3(Sc,Zr) L12 primary micro-precipitates and very fine Al grains. After aging at 300−400°C, the alloys show large increases in hardness, consistent with an exceptionally high number density (1.4 × 1024 m−3) and volume fraction (2.5{\%}) of secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) nano-precipitates with a Sc-rich core and Zr-rich shell, as measured via atom-probe tomography.},

For the first time, this relationship is observed directly and simultaneously by implementing state-of-the-art techniques of high-speed x-ray imaging and integrating-sphere radiometry. Experiments were performed on Ti-6Al-4V solid and powder under single spot laser illumination for laser conditions that cause keyhole formation and collapse. The data from x-ray imaging corroborates that a dramatic rise in laser absorption is due to keyhole formation. We also find that the keyhole area correlates most strongly with energy absorption followed closely by keyhole depth. Furthermore, time synchronization reveals correlations between keyhole fluctuations and sinusoidal variations in energy absorption that occur during nominally “stable” keyhole conditions. Absorption data show a 24 {\%} periodic change in absorbed laser power at a 50 kHz frequency. The absorption peaks correlate to relatively large, open keyholes, whereas images taken at the troughs reveal keyholes with substantial undulations of the keyhole sidewalls. These observations give crucial, quantitative data for computational modeling whose aim is to predict porosity and defect formation.},

The high temporal and spatial resolution available in the measurement allowed us to study the rapid evolution of the melted region beneath the surface of the sample. The characterization of the evolution of secondary phases, i.e., Laves and carbide, was captured despite the weak diffracted peaks caused by small volume fractions. Thermal history was estimated based on changes in the lattice spacing from the thermal contraction upon cooling. The temporal variation in 2$\theta$ with azimuthal direction revealed the evolution in anisotropy of lattice spacing and thus of the mechanical state during laser processing.},
