abstract = {Laser based directed energy deposition (DED) is a competitive method for repairing and remanufacturing metallic parts used in numerous industries including aerospace and biomedical. However, the numerous dynamic phenomena associated with the DED process often result in defects such as entrapped-gas pores, lack of fusion, and undesirable anisotropic properties. The entrapped-gas pore, being one of the most common issues, not only influences melt-pool dynamics but also reduces the fabrication quality and mechanical properties of parts fabricated by the DED process. To reduce and further understand this issue, the real-time observation of the pore formation process needs to be studied first. To directly observe the phenomena in the melt pool, high-speed techniques are needed because rapid solidification leads to rapid pore formation and movement. In-situ high-speed X-ray has been proven to be an effective method in investigating the melt pool dynamics and pore formation mechanisms in the laser powder bed fusion process, in which the fabrication process is quite different from that in DED. Here, the high-speed X-ray method is extended to study the formation of entrapped-gas pores. The real-time formation and quantitative analysis of pores under each set of processing parameters (particle velocity, laser power, and spot welding dwelling time of stationary laser) in the DED process are investigated. We found that the DED with a higher particle velocity (3.19 m/s) produced a smaller average pore size of 27.8 µm and a lower pore area fraction of 0.52%. The DED under lower laser power (156 W) generated a smaller average pore size of 20.3 µm and a lower pore area fraction of 1.94%. The shorter dwelling time (10 ms) benefited the decrease of both average pore size and pore area fraction.},

While powder with a low entrapped gas content showed no net part porosity increase, the results showed a strong correlation between the porosity in the powder and the porosity in the builds made from powder with a high entrapped gas content relative to typical gas-atomized powder.

abstract = {Laser melting technologies in welding and additive manufacturing, such as laser powder bed fusion, promises to revolutionize manufacturing. However, a challenge remains in preventing pore defects produced by melt pool instabilities, which degrade part quality. Using X-ray imaging synchronized with ultrahigh-speed (40 ns) absorption radiometry and coupled with high-fidelity simulations, we discovered that periodic oscillations in the melt pool's morphology existed prior to a transition to chaotic and pore-generating turbulence. Over-extension by recoil waves followed by surface-tension driven recession created temporary pores that persisted longer in a multimodal regime. This non-linear hydrodynamics exists in both shallow and deep melt pools, but most strongly affects the latter. Early prevention of this transition will help improve the quality of manufactured parts. This work demonstrates that remote sensing of these oscillations is possible by very high time resolution total light scattering measurements, which is more readily achievable in an industrial setting than 2-dimensional melt pool imaging.},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a dominant process in the fast-emerging additive manufacturing (AM) industry. Despite the many advantages that can be gained by adopting AM, sustained future growth in this industrial sector requires AM to overcome several barriers, most notably, the formation of in-part defects and the high production cost. Motivated by the growing interest of reducing feedstock cost, we studied the cost-efficient hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti-6Al-4 V powder in L-PBF and show that the in-part porosity can be controlled to produce nearly fully dense (> 99.8% density) components by optimizing process parameters. The process map that was developed with the HDH powder offers a general guideline for the usage of non-spherical powder in powder bed AM. In this work, we investigated the size, morphology, and spatial distribution of the powder-induced porosity in 3D and quantified the interaction between the HDH powder layer and keyhole fluctuation in-situ by utilizing advanced synchrotron-based x-ray computed tomography and dynamic x-ray radiography. With the assistance of a Monte Carlo image-based analysis, we propose two porosity formation mechanisms and attribute them to the unique characteristics of the HDH powder bed, i.e., variable local packing and larger particle size.},

Two separate DED systems, one with high powder flow rates to represent industrial-scale DED processing and the other with low powder flow rates for individual particle tracking, were synchronized with the high-speed imaging setup at the Advanced Photon Source in Argonne National Laboratory. In-situ x-ray imaging of the DED process using both systems highlighted the influence of powder flow rates. Increased powder flow rates resulted in less laser absorption into the melt pool, leading to a transition from a keyhole mode to a melt pool without a keyhole but with surface fluctuations due to powder flow. Increased velocities of particles during powder flow resulted in a decrease in particle melting times and a greater propensity for porosity formation. Overall, better understanding of the interactions that occur during various scales of the DED process will enable flexibility, control, and new materials development in DED-based additive manufacturing.},

abstract = {To date, the primary focus of metal additive manufacturing (AM) research has been the development of strategies for fabricating complex architectures, reducing internal stress and optimizing microstructure. Traditional Al alloys have presented further challenges in this effort due to solidification cracking and complex laser coupling dynamics. To overcome these limitations, identification of novel alloys that exploit the rapid solidification conditions inherent in laser-based AM is required. In this work, laser-induced melting of an Al-8Ce-10Mg alloy is revealed to generate a nanoscale microstructure which results in improved hardness, tensile strength, and mitigated solidification cracking (e.g., hot tearing) in single laser tracks in as-cast material and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF)-fabricated components. In situ X-ray imaging shows the nanostructure arises from laser-induced melting of intermetallic particles embedded into the alloy during casting and then rapid resolidification of the molten material in $\sim$ 400 µs. The formed Ce-rich nanostructures are highly resistant to thermal coarsening at 300 °C, as confirmed by microscopy and retention of tensile properties. These results pave the way for development of AM-specific Al alloys that possess the ability to form mechanically favorable nanostructures in fabricated components due to the rapid cooling inherent in LPBF.},

The laws apply broadly and remain accurate for different materials, processing conditions, and printing machines. We define a new dimensionless number, the Keyhole number, to predict aspect ratio of a keyhole and the morphological transition from stable at low Keyhole number to chaotic at high Keyhole number. Furthermore, we discover inherent correlation between keyhole stability and porosity formation in metal 3D printing. By reducing the dimensions of the formulation of these challenging problems, the compact scaling laws will aid process optimization and defect elimination during metal 3D printing, and potentially lead to a quantitative predictive framework.</jats:p>},

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a dominant process in the fast-emerging additive manufacturing (AM) industry. Despite the many advantages that can be gained by adopting AM, sustained future growth in this industrial sector requires AM to overcome several barriers, most notably, the formation of in-part defects and the high production cost. Motivated by the growing interest of reducing feedstock cost, we studied the cost-efficient hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti-6Al-4 V powder in L-PBF and show that the in-part porosity can be controlled to produce nearly fully dense (> 99.8% density) components by optimizing process parameters. The process map that was developed with the HDH powder offers a general guideline for the usage of non-spherical powder in powder bed AM. In this work, we investigated the size, morphology, and spatial distribution of the powder-induced porosity in 3D and quantified the interaction between the HDH powder layer and keyhole fluctuation in-situ by utilizing advanced synchrotron-based x-ray computed tomography and dynamic x-ray radiography. With the assistance of a Monte Carlo image-based analysis, we propose two porosity formation mechanisms and attribute them to the unique characteristics of the HDH powder bed, i.e., variable local packing and larger particle size.},

However, pores formed during the printing process impair the mechanical performance of the printed parts, severely hindering their widespread application. Here, we report six pore formation mechanisms that were observed during the LPBF process. Our results reconfirm three pore formation mechanisms - keyhole induced pores, pore formation from feedstock powder and pore formation along the melting boundary during laser melting from vaporization of a volatile substance or an expansion of a tiny trapped gas. We also observe three new pore formation mechanisms: (1) pore trapped by surface fluctuation, (2) pore formation due to depression zone fluctuation when the depression zone is shallow and (3) pore formation from a crack. The results presented here provide direct evidence and insight into pore formation mechanisms during the LPBF process, which may guide the development of pore elimination/mitigation approaches. Since certain laser processing conditions studied here are similar to the situations in high energy density laser welding, the results presented here also have implications for laser welding.},

The gas-driven powder motions in laser powder bed fusion have significant influence on the build quality. However, the transient powder-gas interaction has not been well understood due to the challenges in quantitative experiment measurements. In this work, the powder-gas interaction for a single pulse laser illuminating on the powder bed is studied. We establish a multi-physics model to simulate the complex liquid/gas flow as well as the gas-driven powder motions, which is substantiated by high-speed synchrotron x-ray imaging. We identify and quantify four characteristic modes of powder-gas interaction in LPBF. The motion of a powder is controlled by one or multiple interaction modes collectively. As revealed by simulations and confirmed by experiments, powders can merge into the molten pool from its rim, be ejected at different divergence angles (powder spattering), or dive into the molten pool to cause significant molten pool fluctuation. Our results provide insights toward the driving forces controlling the dynamic powder behavior, which pave the way for reducing structure defects during the build process.},

abstract = {During high-power laser metal processing, the absorbed light is intimately related to the molten metal cavity shape. For the first time, this relationship is observed directly and simultaneously by implementing state-of-the-art techniques of high-speed x-ray imaging and integrating-sphere radiometry. Experiments were performed on Ti-6Al-4V solid and powder under single spot laser illumination for laser conditions that cause keyhole formation and collapse. The data from x-ray imaging corroborates that a dramatic rise in laser absorption is due to keyhole formation. We also find that the keyhole area correlates most strongly with energy absorption followed closely by keyhole depth. Furthermore, time synchronization reveals correlations between keyhole fluctuations and sinusoidal variations in energy absorption that occur during nominally “stable” keyhole conditions. Absorption data show a 24 % periodic change in absorbed laser power at a 50 kHz frequency. The absorption peaks correlate to relatively large, open keyholes, whereas images taken at the troughs reveal keyholes with substantial undulations of the keyhole sidewalls. These observations give crucial, quantitative data for computational modeling whose aim is to predict porosity and defect formation.},

This study investigates elemental alloying elements (Sc and Zr) which are high-melting and highly reactive, unlike previous work which focused on more concentrated elemental additions of lower-melting, lower-reactivity Cu and Si to aluminum. High-speed in situ synchrotron x-ray imaging and diffraction show that the 20−30 $\mu$m Al, Sc, and Zr powders fully melt and sufficiently mix in the molten state to create, on solidification, a homogeneous distribution of primary, micron-size L12 precipitates (Al3Sc, Al3Zr, and Al3(Sc,Zr), respectively) and nucleate micron-size Al matrix grains, as confirmed by SEM imaging of cross-sections. A second laser pass, simulating a realistic additive-manufacturing build condition, fully remelts the initial volume which shows, after solidification, the same Al3(Sc,Zr) L12 primary micro-precipitates and very fine Al grains. After aging at 300−400°C, the alloys show large increases in hardness, consistent with an exceptionally high number density (1.4 × 1024 m−3) and volume fraction (2.5%) of secondary Al3(Sc,Zr) nano-precipitates with a Sc-rich core and Zr-rich shell, as measured via atom-probe tomography.},

Here, we report the direct observation and quantification of melt pool variation during the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process under constant input energy density by in-situ high-speed high-energy x-ray imaging. We show that the melt pool can undergo different melting regimes and both the melt pool dimension and melt pool volume can have orders-of-magnitude change under a constant input energy density. Our analysis shows that the significant melt pool variation cannot be solely explained by the energy dissipation rate. We found that energy absorption changes significantly under a constant input energy density, which is another important cause of melt pool variation. Our further analysis reveals that the significant change in energy absorption originates from the separate roles of laser power and scan speed in depression zone development. The results reported here are important for understanding the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process and guiding the development of better metrics for processing parameter design.},

The synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (CT) and high-speed imaging results worked together to identify the location of the critical flaw and to capture the dynamics of crack propagation. In all experiments, the critical flaw was located on the surface of each specimen. The AM specimens showed significantly higher crack propagation speed, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, strain hardening coefficient, and yet lower ductility compared to the cast specimens under dynamic tension. Although the strength values were higher for the AM specimens, the critical mode I stress intensity factors were comparable for both specimens. The microstructures of the samples were characterized by CT and scanning electron microcopy. The correlation between the dynamic fracture behavior of the samples and the microstructure of the samples is analyzed and discussed.},

Since 4140 has received only minimal attention in the AM literature, focus here was on the effects of melt pool dynamics, vapor cavity depths, build layer height, and the origin of porosity on the 4140 as-built microstructure. Four build parameter sets, which enabled variation of laser power, scan speed, laser spot size, and specific energy density (SED), were applied. Vapor cavity and melt pool depths were measured for each single-track laser scan. Direct imaging of the LPBF process demonstrated that the primary source of porosity in the build originates from incorporation of entrapped gas within the powder irrespective of build parameter set. High resolution SEM and EBSD demonstrated that the as-built microstructure did not vary significantly with build parameter set over a broad range of SED. The fast solidification rates observed (0.06–0.08 m/s) lead to fine martensite packet/block size distributions (1–3 µm) with the potential for increased material strength.},

This study introduces a piezo-driven powder deposition system that allows for imaging of individual powder particles that flow into a scanning melt pool.

abstract = {A high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging technique was used to investigate the binder jetting additive manufacturing (AM) process. A commercial binder jetting printer with droplet-on-demand ink-jet print-head was used to print single lines on powder beds. The printing process was recorded in real time using high-speed X-ray imaging. The ink-jet droplets showed distinct elongated shape with spherical head, long tail, and three to five trailing satellite droplets. Significant drift was observed between the impact points of main droplet and satellite droplets. The impact of the droplet on the powder bed caused movement and ejection of the powder particles. The depth of disturbance in the powder bed from movement and ejection was defined as interaction depth, which is found to be dependent on the size, shape, and material of the powder particles. For smaller powder particles (diameter less than 10 $\mu$m), three consecutive binder droplets were observed to coalesce to form large agglomerates. The observations reported here will facilitate the understanding of underlying physics that govern the binder jetting processes, which will then help in improving the quality of parts manufactured using this AM process.},

Evolution of the repose angle, slope surface speed, slope surface roughness, and the dynamics of powder clusters at the powder front were revealed and quantified.

The effects of particle size on powder flow dynamics were revealed.

abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing and laser welding are powerful metal processing techniques with broad applications in advanced sectors such as the biomedical and aerospace industries. One common process variable that can tune laser-material interaction dynamics in these two techniques is adjustment of the composition and pressure of the atmosphere in which the process is conducted. While some of the physical mechanisms that are governed by the ambient pressure are well known from the welding literature, it remains unclear how these mechanisms extend to the distinct process conditions of LPBF. In situ studies of the differences in subsurface structure and behavior are essential for understanding the effects of gas pressure and composition on the LPBF processes. This article reports the use of in situ X-ray imaging to directly probe the morphological evolution of the liquid-vapor interface during laser melting as a function of ambient pressure and oxygen partial pressure under LPBF conditions in 316 L steel, Ti-64, aluminum 6061, and Nickel 400. We observe significant changes in melt pool morphology as a function of pressure. Furthermore, similar changes in morphology occur due to an increase in oxygen partial pressure in the process atmosphere. Temperature- and composition-dependent changes in surface tension of the liquid metal drive this change in behavior, which has the potential to influence defect creation and final morphology in LPBF parts.},

We found that the boundary of the keyhole porosity regime in power-velocity space is sharp and smooth, varying only slightly between the bare plate and powder bed.

@article{Chen2020,
abstract = {The joining of Inconel 718 and 316 stainless steel has notable industrial importance. However, traditional arc-welding has many issues. In particular, the formation of the detrimental Nb-rich Laves phase in the heat affected zone can promote crack initiation and propagation, which leads to poor mechanical properties. The small heat input and the rapid solidification of laser powder bed fusion (PBF) has the potential to suppress this problem. Despite the infancy of the multi-material PBF, it is of interest to investigate the relationship among the process parameter, the microstructure at the materials joining point, and the mechanical performance. In this study, we used high-speed x-ray imaging to in-situ monitor the printing of Inconel 718 tracks on a 316H SS substrate via laser powder bed fusion, followed by post-build characterization and testing with SEM, XRD and nanoindentation. We observed that a higher linear energy density resulted in a more diffused interface and a smaller compositional gradient, but as a trade-off, generated more keyhole pores and thermal cracks. We also showed that the built layer exhibited chemical inhomogeneity at two length scales: a tens-of-$\mu$m-scale compositional vortex due to the melt flow, and a sub-$\mu$m-scale Nb-rich dendritic structure due to the non-equilibrium solidification that led to the formation of the Laves phase. It was inferred that the chemical inhomogeneity may benefit the mechanical properties at the interface by providing more interlocking between the two materials and also by limiting the effect of the brittle Laves phase to potentially short range.},

@article{Parab2018a,
abstract = {The high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging technique was synchronized with a custom-built laser-melting setup to capture the dynamics of laser powder-bed fusion processes in situ. Various significant phenomena, including vapor-depression and melt-pool dynamics and powder-spatter ejection, were captured with high spatial and temporal resolution. Imaging frame rates of up to 10 MHz were used to capture the rapid changes in these highly dynamic phenomena. At the same time, relatively slow frame rates were employed to capture large-scale changes during the process. This experimental platform will be vital in the further understanding of laser additive manufacturing processes and will be particularly helpful in guiding efforts to reduce or eliminate microstructural defects in additively manufactured parts.},

@article{Gould2021,
abstract = {Laser powder bed fusion is a metal additive manufacturing technique that has received significant scientific and industrial attention over the past decades. However, the quality and reproducibility of parts manufactured by this technique is still a problem. Overcoming this issue requires an understanding of multiple complex physical phenomena which occur simultaneously during the process. This work illustrates a powerful new technique which synchronizes high-speed x-ray imaging with high-speed infrared imaging to study laser powder bed fusion processes in real time. Using this technique, we demonstrate the simultaneous observation of multiple phenomena including three-dimensional melt pool visualization, vapor plume dynamics, spatter formation, thermal history, and point cooling rates. The paired observation of these dynamic phenomena is critical to understanding the fundamentals of laser powder bed fusion, and the overall impact of process parameters on print quality.},

This study investigates the influence of powder deposition for Ti-6Al-4V using synchronized X-ray and thermal infrared imaging. Melt pool geometry and their theoretical estimates as well as thermal histories are compared between a clad without and with powder deposition. The results show how powder deposition causes fluctuations in geometry and thermal histories. Fundamental understanding of the influence of powder deposition into a melt pool can lead to better prediction of melt pool geometry, thermal history, and better controlled processing.},
