abstract = {The short pulse duration, small effective source size and high flux of synchrotron radiation is ideally suited for probing a wide range of transient deformation processes in materials under extreme conditions. In this paper, the challenges of high-resolution time-resolved indirect X-ray detection are reviewed in the context of dynamic synchrotron experiments. In particular, the discussion is targeted at two-dimensional integrating detector methods, such as those focused on dynamic radiography and diffraction experiments. The response of a scintillator to periodic synchrotron X-ray excitation is modelled and validated against experimental data collected at the Diamond Light Source (DLS) and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). An upper bound on the dynamic range accessible in a time-resolved experiment for a given bunch separation is calculated for a range of scintillators. New bunch structures are suggested for DLS and ESRF using the highest-performing commercially available crystal LYSO:Ce, allowing time-resolved experiments with an interframe time of 189?ns and a maximum dynamic range of 98 (6.6 bits).},

@article{Olbinado2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 Optical Society of America. Third generation synchrotron light sources offer high photon flux, partial spatial coherence, and $\sim$10-10 s pulse widths. These enable hard X-ray phase-contrast imaging (XPCI) with single-bunch temporal resolutions. In this work, we exploited the MHz repetition rates of synchrotron X-ray pulses combined with indirect X-ray detection to demonstrate the potential of XPCI with millions of frames per second multiple-frame recording. This allows for the visualization of aperiodic or stochastic transient processes which are impossible to be realized using single-shot or stroboscopic XPCI. We present observations of various phenomena, such as crack tip propagation in glass, shock wave propagation in water and explosion during electric arc ignition, which evolve in the order of km/s ($\mu$m/ns).},
