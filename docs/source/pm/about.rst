A synchrotron-based X-ray projection microscope is a type of X-ray imaging system that utilizes synchrotron radiation as its X-ray source to create two-dimensional projection images of objects. Synchrotron radiation provides intense and highly collimated X-ray beams, allowing for high-resolution imaging capabilities.
