An X-ray transmission X-ray microscope (TXM) is a powerful imaging tool that utilizes X-rays to visualize the internal structure of samples with high resolution. Unlike optical microscopes, which use visible light, X-ray microscopes exploit the short wavelengths of X-rays to achieve imaging resolutions beyond the diffraction limit of light.

TXMs have various applications in materials science, biology, geology, and other fields where imaging the internal structure of samples is essential. They can provide valuable insights into the microscopic features of materials, such as the arrangement of grains in a metal alloy, the cellular structure of biological specimens, or the distribution of minerals in a rock sample. Additionally, synchrotron-based TXMs offer even higher resolutions and sensitivity, making them particularly useful for cutting-edge research applications.
